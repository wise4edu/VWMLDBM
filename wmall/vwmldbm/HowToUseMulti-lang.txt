A. To use multi-lang change list box,
  1. include VWMLDBM "config.php" from the host script. 
	eg, suppose the host script is "/htdocs/host_program/customer/index.php"
		and VWMLDBM path is "/htdocs/host_program/vwmldbm/".	
		From the host script, " require_once("../vwmldbm/config.php"); "
  
  2. call "\vwmldbm\code\mlang_change_list();"
	eg, <?\vwmldbm\code\mlang_change_list();?>
	
	
B. To use multi-lang field names,
  1. Enter field names using "RMD"
  
  2. include VWMLDBM "config.php" from the host script. 
	eg, suppose the host script is "/htdocs/host_program/customer/index.php"
		and VWMLDBM path is "/htdocs/host_program/vwmldbm/".	
		From the host script, " require_once("../vwmldbm/config.php"); "
  
  3. call "\vwmldbm\code\get_field_name("table_name_without_prefix","field_name")"
		eg, <?PHP \vwmldbm\code\get_field_name("customer","first_name");?>
	
	
C. To use multi-lang Texts (not field names),
  1. Modify JSON files: eg, "/htdocs/host_program/vwmldbm/mlang/30.json" for Korean:
  2. include VWMLDBM "config.php" from the host script. 
	eg, suppose the host script is "/htdocs/host_program/customer/index.php"
		and VWMLDBM path is "/htdocs/host_program/vwmldbm/".	
		From the host script, " require_once("../vwmldbm/config.php"); "
  
  3. insert code: "$wmlang[menu][customer_list]"
		eg, <?=$wmlang[menu][customer_list]?>
